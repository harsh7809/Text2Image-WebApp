This web application, built with Django, enables users to generate images from text input. Leveraging the stability.ai API, the application converts user-provided text into images and persists them in a database. Users can conveniently view the generated images through the web interface. To handle image generation efficiently, the project utilizes Celery and Redis, ensuring smooth processing without overloading the server.
